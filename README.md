# SE-Europe-Data_Challenge_Template

This repository is for the NUWE - Schneider Electric European Data Science Challenge in November 2023.

## Description
- **Project goal**: To predict the country with the highest surplus of green energy in the next hour using time-series data from the ENTSO-E Transparency portal.
- **Project scope**: The project focuses on nine European countries: Spain, UK, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and the Netherlands. The surplus of green energy is the difference between the generated green energy (wind, solar, geothermic, etc.) and the consumed energy (load).
- **Project workflow**: The project involves data ingestion, ETL, data monitoring, model training, and model prediction. This repository comes from a template provided by Schneider Electric.
